/* ft_memset */ - Fills (n bytes) of array elements with a character (which is passed as an argument).

/* ft_bzero */ - Fills an array with zeros.

/* ft_memcpy */ - Copies to the buffer (n bytes) the characters of the string.

/ * ft_memccpy * / - Copies the characters (n bytes) of the string to the buffer before the specified character.

/ * ft_memmove * / - Copies (n number of characters), that can overlap.

/ * ft_memchr * / - Finds a character in a string and returns a pointer to it.

/ * ft_memcmp * / - Compares two lines, outputs the difference between the characters.

/ * ft_memalloc * / - Selects the dynamic memory of type void.

/ * ft_memdel * / - Frees memory after "malloc".

/ * ft_isalpha * / - Checks whether this is a letter.

/ * ft_isdigit * / - Checks whether this is a digit.

/ * ft_isalnum * / - Checks whether this is a digit or a letter.

/ * ft_isascii * / - Checks whether the character is an ASCII table.

/ * ft_isprint * / - Checks if a character is output (we will see it or not).

/ * ft_toupper * / - Lower letters are converted to upper letters.

/ * ft_tolower * / - Upper letters are converted to lower letters.

__For digit:__

/ * ft_atoi * / - Translates from a data type character to an int data type.

/ * ft_itoa * / - Translates from a data type int to a data type char and returns an array.

/ * ft_sqrt * / - Determines from which number the root is square.

__For string:__

/ * ft_strlen * / - Counts the number of characters in the string (without '\0').

/ * ft_strdup * / - Duplicates the string.

/ * ft_strcpy * / - Copies a string to the buffer.

/ * ft_strncpy * / - Copies the bytes of the string to the buffer (n bytes).

/ * ft_strcat * / - Connects two lines.

/ * ft_strncat * / - Connects two lines (n bytes) or to end of line.

/ * ft_strlcat * / - Connects two lines and returns the total number of characters.

/ * ft_strchr * / - Finds a character in a string and returns a pointer to it.

/ * ft_strrchr * / - Find the last character in the string and return the pointer to it.

/ * ft_strstr * / - Searches for a string in a string and returns a pointer to the first character of the string that was searched for.

/ * ft_strnstr * / - Searches for a string in a string, only (n number), and returns a pointer to the first character of the string that was searched for.

/ * ft_strcmp * / - Compares two lines and outputs the difference of characters.

/ * ft_strncmp * / - Compares (n number) the characters of two lines and outputs the difference of characters.

/ * ft_strnew * / - Allocates a dynamic char memory.

/ * ft_strdel * / - Extends the string after "malloc".

/ * ft_strclr * / - The entire line is overwritten with '\ 0'.

/ * ft_striter * / - Each character of the string passes to a function (which is passed through a pointer).

/ * ft_striteri * / - Each character in the string and the index passes the function.

/ * ft_strmap * / - Creates a new line and writes the result of the function to which we are passing the string.

/ * ft_strmapi * / - Creates a new line and writes the result of the function to which we pass the string and index.

/ * ft_strequ * / - Verifies two lines: 1 - if they are identical and 0 - if not.

/ * ft_strnequ * / - Compare two (n number) characters in a string: 1 - if they are identical and 0 - if not.

/ * ft_strsub * / - Copies from a specific character a string, a specified number of characters.

/ * ft_strjoin * / - Combines two lines into one.

/ * ft_strtrim * / - Writes a string with no spaces at the beginning and at the end.

/ * ft_strsplit * / - Separates a string using a delimiter into separate word arrays.

/ * ft_count_words * / - Counts how many words per line are based on the delimiter.

/ * ft_putchar * / - Displays the symbol.

/ * ft_putstr * / - Displays the line.

/ * ft_putnbr * / - Displays the int data type.

/ * ft_putchar_fd * / - Writes a character to the form.

/ * ft_putstr_fd * / - Writes a string to the form.

/ * ft_putendl_fd * / - Writes a string to the form and puts '\ n' at the end.

/ * ft_putnbr_fd * / - Writes the data type int, translating to char, into the form.

__For list:__

/ * ft_lstnew * / - Creates a new list element and writes the content there.

/ * ft_lstdelone * / - Releases one list item.

/ * ft_lstdel * / - Releases leaf elements and sets the pointer to NULL.

/ * ft_lstiter * / - Sends to a function (whose address is passed to parameters) each sheet element.

/ * ft_lstadd * / - Adds an element to the list.
